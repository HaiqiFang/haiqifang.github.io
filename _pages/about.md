I am a first-year PhD student in the Department of Civil Engineering at Columbia University. I obtained my M.E. and B.E. at Sichuan University. 

My research interests include coastal engineering, coastal oceanography, and surface gravity waves.

# Research Projects

## Near-Resonance Liquid Sloshing Under Surge Excitation

This study focuses on liquid sloshing near secondary resonance. We formulated a new closed-form analytical solution to study the differences in wave dynamics on the super- and sub-sides of the secondary resonance. We discovered a phase transition as the excitation frequency exceeds the resonance point, with the second-order free surface waves dominating the process. A series of experiments were conducted to support the theoretical findings.

## Stokes Waves in a Linear Shear Current

In coastal and deep-water areas, shear currents with vorticity are often generated by wind stress, affecting the dynamic properties of nonlinear waves. We discovered that for strongly sheared currents, existing solutions become unstable with pronounced secondary fluctuations, so we formulated a solution with improved performance. By removing the non-physical assumption that wave height equals two times the first-order wave amplitude (H=2A) and introducing a new time-scale transformation to ensure solvability, we proposed a more physical solution that better describes waves with higher nonlinearity and in stronger currents.

## Wave Scattering by Coastal Sandbars

Natural sandbars in coastal seabeds can reflect surface waves, with classical theory indicating resonance when the ratio of the sandbars' wavenumber to that of the incident waves equals two. However, in practice, real resonance typically occurs when the ratio is less than two, indicating a "downshift" behavior. This has been observed experimentally and numerically, but the underlying mechanism remained unclear. By developing a new theory based on the multi-scale expansion method, we proposed nonlinear coupled equations and closed-form analytical solutions that effectively capture the downshift.

## Wave Transformation Over 2-D and 3-D Permeable Varying Seabeds

As my initial project, I studied wave transformation over porous structures. Strong nonlinearity and singularities introduced by permeable effects made the analysis challenging. Therefore, I applied the Homotopy analysis method, which decomposes a nonlinear differential operator into linear ones. I successfully proposed analytical solutions by constructing Homotopy equations and introducing differential transformations to avoid singularities.

## Wave Attenuation by Vegetation Considering Current Effects

As a co-author, I was responsible for the formulation of theoretical solutions. We established solutions for wave attenuation by vegetation for both strong and weak currents and formulated a new parameterization for the drag coefficient.
