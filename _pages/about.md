I am a first year PhD student in the department of Civil Engineering at Columbia University. I obtained my M.E. and B.E. at Sichuan Univeristy. 


My research interest includes coastal engineering, coastal oceanography and gravity surface waves.

## Bragg Scattering by coastal sandbars and varying topography
<small>
Natural sandbars in coastal seabeds can reflect surface waves, and classical theory indicates that resonance occurs when the ratio of the wavenumber of the sandbars to that of the incident waves equals two. Engineers have widely applied this to design artificial bars that protect coastal infrastructures. However, in practice, real resonance typically occurs when the ratio is less than two, indicating a ‘downshift’ behavior. This has been observed both experimentally and numerically for decades, but the formative mechanism has remained unclear. Moreover, existing analytical solutions either lead to unbounded solutions at resonance or cannot predict the downshift. The practical significance and limitations in existing theories inspired me to develop a new theory. Finally, based on the multi-scale expansion method, I proposed new nonlinear coupled equations and closed-form analytical solutions. The solutions not only remain valid and bounded under any condition, but also effectively capture the downshift. My study further revealed the underlying mechanism of the downshift, which arises from wave re-reflection and modulation processes that lead to a detuning of wave speed.
