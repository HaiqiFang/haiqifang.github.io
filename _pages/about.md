I am a first year PhD student in the department of Civil Engineering at Columbia University. I obtained my M.E. and B.E. at Sichuan Univeristy. 


My research interest includes coastal engineering, coastal oceanography and gravity surface waves.

## Wave Scattering by coastal sandbars

Natural sandbars in coastal seabeds can reflect surface waves, and classical theory indicates that resonance occurs when the ratio of the wavenumber of the sandbars to that of the incident waves equals two. Engineers have widely applied this to design artificial bars that protect coastal infrastructures. 

However, in practice, real resonance typically occurs when the ratio is less than two, indicating a ‘downshift’ behavior. This has been observed both experimentally and numerically for decades, but the formative mechanism has remained unclear. Moreover, existing analytical solutions either lead to unbounded solutions at resonance or cannot predict the downshift. The practical significance and limitations in existing theories inspired me to develop a new theory. Finally, based on the multi-scale expansion method, I proposed new nonlinear coupled equations and closed-form analytical solutions. The solutions not only remain valid and bounded under any condition, but also effectively capture the downshift. My study further revealed the underlying mechanism of the downshift, which arises from wave re-reflection and modulation processes that lead to a detuning of wave speed.

## Wave transformation over permeable varying seabeds

As my initial project, I studied wave transformation over porous structures. Strong nonlinearity and singularities, introduced by permeable effects, made the analysis rather challenging using traditional methods. For this reason, I was motivated to find a more effective tool, and the Homotopy analysis method was the ideal candidate due to its ability to decompose a nonlinear differential operator into linear ones. Eventually, I constructed Homotopy equations and introduced differential transformations to avoid singularities, and, for the first time, successfully proposed analytical solutions.
